# How To Downgrade Your Terraria Client
1. You will need 1.4.0.5 terraria, you can get this by downloading our modified [Depot Downloader]() and extracting the file, then run the `GET-1.4.0.5.BAT` file like you would an EXE.

2. Go to `Depots` then to `105601` and lastly `5683958`. Now you have 1.4.0.5 terraria and you will still have your new terraria installed.

# How To Use The Server
